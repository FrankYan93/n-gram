# N-gram Statistics

## Author

## Summary
Last project of my first python course in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.   
This program is designed to analyze the word frequency of a text.  
It can split a text by some identifiers(the list `num` in my program) and calculate the frequency of words or n-gram phrase.  
There is also a matrix of some statistics.  
Learning this course, I can feel the magic of programming. Then I chose to start my journey in computer science.

## Technical Description
I just used `Tkinter` as the GUI.  
`tkSimpleDialog` for user input.  
The default input file is `bill_of_rights.txt`.  
Other text files are generated with this file's information.

## What's else
I modified a little to make this program run on both windows and unix-like systems.  
Also, I changed some code since the package had been updated.  
I really learned some new things by revisiting this project.
